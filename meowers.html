                This is Noni! She was the first cat we welcomed into our house. She has been apart of the family since last year in May. 
                She was once a poor stray cat roaming outside the neighbourhood. I once had a dream where I took in Noni as my cat, and the very next day I adopted her!.She is a year old girl now!. Though she is an odd cat, doesnt like pats that much.

                This is Momo, our second cat. We adopted him when he was a tiny 1 month old baby from my eldest brother. Apperently his mother was quite irresponsible with her child so we decided to take care of him instead. Hes a dumb siamese cat. Hes a fat guy, only 8-9 months old.

                My third cat is Amoi! We adopted her a few weeks after adopting Momo. During that day, my parents were on their way to their car when suddenly they heard a faint meow.
                 Amoi was actually stuck in a car next to theirs and there was a chinese lady trying to displace Amoi from that same car. Thus her name, Amoi. She is quite small, given the fact shes the same age as Momo.
                 She can also devour a whole can of cat food all by herself, so that might not be the reason.

                My fourth and fifth cat are twins! The eldest twin is named Kiki. Fun fact, almost all my cats names except Amoi was suggested by Izzan my pookie wookie bear :3.
                Their mother is actually Noni! Kiki is only 4-5 months old but he is as big as their mother. Kiki meows a lot and craves attention, he will bite you if you refuse to pat him. That silly idiot.

                My fifth and last cat is Koko. One way to differentiate them is by the fur, where Koko has a more darker orange than Kiki. Koko's a quite cat, doesnt purr much when you pet him, 
                and only meows if he is all alone, and he has the cutest meow. I'd say the twins have very nice fur.
